# HUD
HUD is a simple Landscape tile with helpful system information.

Currently, it will display our own urbit's uptime, our home and bash desk hashes, our own life and rift, and the values we have for another ship'd life and rift.

In the future, additional information and features would be added, including |hi-like poking, checking our parent ship's %base hash, %kids hash, uptime, (would be made scryable by parent ship's %hud), system performance information a la |mass (currently not available within arvo) et c.
